## Privacy Policy

Let’s keep this simple.

This website exists for personal and professional fun (mostly to show off some side projects and data experiments). There’s no tracking for ads, no dark patterns, and no shady stuff.

I use Google Analytics to understand how the site’s being used (e.g. what pages people visit). That’s it. It’s all anonymous and aggregate, and I’m not selling or sharing your data. Mostly I’m just glad someone made it this far.

If you’re concerned, feel free to browse in incognito mode — no hard feelings.

Thanks for visiting!
