  <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">This site is just for fun. I use Google Analytics, and Google Analytics uses cookies to work. I'm only using Analytics to understand traffic patterns and which pages people are interested in. I'm not using this data for anything sinister. Relax, browse freely, and know you're not being tracked in any creepy or commercial way.</p>
